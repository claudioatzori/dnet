      <dc:description>Information systems are becoming increasingly complex, involving massive amounts of data coming from different sources. Information is often inconsistent, incomplete, heterogeneous, and pervaded with uncertainty. The International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management (SUM) conferences series provides an international forum about the management of uncertain, incomplete, or inconsistent information. This volume contains the papers presented at the 8th International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management (SUM 2014), which was held St. Anne's College, Oxford, UK, September 15-17, 2014. The call for papers solicited submissions in two categories: regular research papers and short papers reporting on interesting work in progress or providing system descriptions. The call for papers resulted in 47 submissions. Based on the review reports and discussions, 26 papers were accepted for publication and presentation at the conference, among which 20 regular papers and 6 short papers. The conference program also included invited lectures by three leading researchers: Anthony Hunter (Department of Computer Science, University College London), Jens Lehmann (Department of Computer Science, University of Leipzig), and Dan Olteanu (Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford). A conference such as this can only succeed as a team effort. We would like to thank several people and institutions: the authors of submitted papers, the invited speakers, and the conference participants; the members of the Program Committee and the external referees; Alfred Hofmann and Springer for providing assistance and advice in the preparation of the proceedings; the University of Oxford for providing local facilities; the creators and maintainers of the conference management system EasyChair. All of them made the success of SUM 2014 possible.</dc:description>
